ChatGuard: AI-Powered Scam Detection Chatbot
![alt text](./chatguard-demo.gif)

(Optional: It's highly recommended to create a short GIF like this to showcase your project in action!)
ChatGuard is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how to build a real-time, AI-powered scam detection system within a chatbot interface. The system analyzes user messages to identify patterns of phishing, fraud, and spam, and issues an immediate alert.
This project was built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, showcasing a complete workflow from data processing and model training to an interactive web application.
üöÄ Features
AI Scam Detection Engine: A core module that uses a machine learning model to classify messages as "scam" or "legitimate."
Real-Time Analysis: Every message sent to the chatbot is instantly analyzed for potential risks.
Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that simulates a real chat application.
Clear Risk Alerts: When a potential scam is detected, a prominent warning is displayed with the model's confidence score.
Modular Codebase: The project is separated into logical parts: model training (train_model.py), the detection engine (chatguard.py), and the front-end (app_streamlit.py).
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend & ML: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib
Frontend: Streamlit
Dataset: SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle
üîß Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatGuard.git
cd ChatGuard
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
code
Bash
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
A requirements.txt file is included for easy installation.
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Dataset
Go to the SMS Spam Collection Dataset on Kaggle.
Download the spam.csv file.
Place the spam.csv file in the root directory of the project.
Running the Project
The project is run in two stages: training the model and then launching the application.
Train the AI Model
This script will process the spam.csv data, train the LogisticRegression model, and save it as chatguard_model.pkl. You only need to run this once.
code
Bash
python train_model.py
You should see a classification report in the terminal and a confirmation that the model was saved.
Launch the Streamlit Web App
This command starts the web server and opens the application in your browser.
code
Bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
Your default web browser will open a new tab with the ChatGuard interface ready to use!
ü§ñ How It Works
The project's intelligence comes from a machine learning pipeline created with Scikit-learn.
Text Vectorization (TfidfVectorizer): The model can't understand raw text. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) converts text messages into numerical vectors, giving more weight to words that are important for distinguishing between scam and legitimate messages. We use ngram_range=(1, 2) to consider both single words and two-word phrases (e.g., "click here").
Classification (LogisticRegression): This algorithm is trained on the vectorized data to find the patterns that separate the two classes. We use the class_weight='balanced' parameter to combat the class imbalance in the dataset, forcing the model to pay more attention to the less frequent but more important "scam" examples.
Real-Time Prediction: When a user types a message in the Streamlit app, the saved pipeline processes the new text and predicts the probability of it being a scam. If the probability exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 50%), an alert is triggered.

üìà Future Improvements
This project serves as a strong foundation. Here are some ways it could be enhanced:
Use Advanced Models: Implement more powerful NLP models like BERT or other transformers for higher accuracy.
Expand the Dataset: Train on a larger, more diverse dataset that includes email phishing, social media scams, etc.
URL Analysis: Add functionality to specifically analyze links in messages for signs of phishing.
Containerization: Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
More Sophisticated Chatbot: Replace the simple rule-based bot with a more advanced conversational AI framework like Rasa or Dialogflow.
